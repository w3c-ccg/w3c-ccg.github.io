# Transitioning a CCG work item

Some work items may be adopted by another group. A common path is for a CCG work item to be adopted by the [Verifiable Credentials Working Group](https://www.w3.org/2017/vc/WG/). Should a CCG work item be adopted by the Verifiable Credentials Working Group, follow the process below to transition the work item:

1. Send an email to the [CCG mailing list](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/), asking the Chairs to request
transition of the work item to the VCWG. They will ask if there are
any objections and note that that the document is ready to be moved
over to VCWG.

2. Amend the work item documents from _CG-DRAFT_ to _CG-FINAL_, and export them to HTML file(s) to be published in the `credentials` directory of the [cg-reports repository](https://github.com/w3c/cg-reports/tree/main/credentials).

3. Upon merge into the [cg-reports repository](https://github.com/w3c/cg-reports), ask the CCG Chairs to publish it as a Final Report using the CCG tooling.

4. Add the current W3C Staff Contact for the VCWG to the repository and give them Admin access. Send them an email, with CC to the VCWG chairs, asking to transfer the repository to W3C, and referring to the resolution in the VCWG minutes where the adoption occurred. 

5. Update the work item document(s), once it is under the W3C organization, to note that the spec is now an "ED" (Editor's Draft).

6. Success! You can continue working on the work item as you normally would.
